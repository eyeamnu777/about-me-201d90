//* Me llama Nù Harley and I only took a couple of classes of Spanish in high school. I am mature for myage; as I skipped the 5th grade because I would get dont with my work early and help (bother according to the teacher) other students. What's funny is I got in trouble in my junior/senior year of college for overly participating; how funny is that. I graduated from The Central State University, a historically black university, with a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Psychology and a minor in Business Administration. Always enjoyed school and a garden tool for knowledge. I love the brain and all of its functions.  Out of college I started out as a substitute teacher at a local city high school by my school and eventually assisted younger grade levels. I fell for the first graders as I had pessismistic thoughts. Firt corporate job was with Huntington National Bank as a teller but quit months in due to a purposely micromanaging manager. Told myself no more corporate jobs due to the restriction and rules I have to abide by that I already know to follow as a person of morals. A goal I have is to become the most thorough, efficient web developer/coder I work myself to be. Networking is my second highest priority aside from learning code. Lastly, creating a legacy for generations after me. All things Nù.//
